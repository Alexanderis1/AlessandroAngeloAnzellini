# GreenPass check with Face Recognition

### The Problem

> From 06/08/2021 in Italy Green Pass is required for accessing the majority of the private locales.
> Checking everytime the qrcode and the document is a great cost in terms of time, crowding and workers.

### My Solution

> Using OpenCV2, Facial_Recognition, a ML model and other dependencies is possible to register a client in the system within 5 seconds.
> From now on the user is register as GreenPass owner and it will never be needed for the owner of the activity to check his qrcode anymore.

### Other Applications

> Installing other cameras in the area, in case of big spaces, it will be possible to check the presence of sneaky entrance in the activity.
> This can be used in case of private events, age restricted event, crowd surveillance and so on.
